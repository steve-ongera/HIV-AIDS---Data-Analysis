# HIV-AIDS---Data-Analysis
This repository contains the project work where the HIV AIDS dataset is analysed and visualized.

The HIV AIDS dataset is taken from the Kaggle website where the original source of the data is from WHO and UNESCO. The dataset has 6 different sub datasets. They include informations as follows(in order):

1. No. of people living with HIV AIDS
2. No. of deaths due to HIV AIDS
3. No. of cases among adults (19-45)
4. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission estimates
5. ART (Anti Retro-viral Therapy) coverage among people living with HIV estimates
6. ART (Anti Retro-viral Therapy) coverage among children estimates


The above datasets I have named as follows(in order):

1. hiv_living_df
2. death_df
3. adult_df
4. mother2child_prevention
5. artCoverage_df
6. pediatricCoverage_df


The datasets are explored clearly, cleaned and preprocessed. Then, the data analysis and visualization techniques are applied to produce meaningful insights from the dataset. Simple visualization techniques are applied to show the precise insights without ambiguity.
